# UI Accessibility

## Figma

I created a prototype for a form in Figma

- The fields change color when they are selected
- The email field shows an error
- The button also changes color on hover.

I used the A11y - Color Contrast Checker plugin to check if the color contrast was AAA compatible, I also used a very readable sans serif font with the font size of 24px

I also tried using the A11y - Focus orderer to see how I would set up the order for tabbed focus.

## HTML using accessibility guidelines

I created a html/css page using the accessability guidelines
