# Universal design

As the name suggests, universal design is a type of design that makes a product or tool easy to use and accessible to the largest number of users possible regardless of their ability, disability, age, and gender.

Universal design, whether for digital technology or the built environment, goes beyond accessibility to take into account individual attributes in addition to disability, including age, gender, race and ethnicity, native language, and other diverse characteristics.

As a result, the goal of universal design isn’t simply to ensure a design is accessible, but also that it can accommodate preferences and desires. For example, while closed captioning provided for videos is intended for those who are deaf or hard of hearing, others may turn them on if they are in a loud environment and cannot hear the words being said in the video, or if the words being spoken are too garbled to understand.

# Inclusive design

Inclusive design is a methodology that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity. Most importantly, this means including and learning from people with a range of perspectives.

While disabilities are accounted for in inclusive design, other identities and characteristics are also considered in design elements like language and imagery. For example, on web forms that require a user to select a gender, the form may go beyond the binary choices of “Male” and “Female” to include a third choice where a user can write in their preferred gender identity. Furthermore, in contrast to universal design, inclusive design may make different design solutions available for different groups of people in order to avoid marginalizing anyone.

# Universal vs. Inclusive design

It all boils down to improving the user experience. Universal design takes a one size fits all approach. When utilizing universal design, UX designers may find themselves looking for the ‘average user’ of the product and end up meeting the needs and wants of an imaginary person. While more time and resource-consuming, inclusive design forces designers to innovate and communicate with their target audience and see what they want and need in a product.

‌Universal design can be a stepping stone for many early-stage projects. But it’s limited in its reach, especially with both digital and physical markets becoming more diverse and global than ever before. Finding ways to serve all potential users regardless of their demographic or background can result in an improved user experience. Universal design might force UX designers to categorize anyone who doesn’t fit within the box of an ‘average user’ as an ‘edge case,’ resulting in them ignoring their needs. On the other hand, inclusive design accommodates both the average user and people with unique circumstances.

‌‌Inclusive design is more time, energy, and resource-intensive, but it makes up for its shortcomings by resulting in products with the greatest numbers of potential users. Inclusively designed products are also open to adaptation and only require occasional small tweaks instead of complete redesigns.
